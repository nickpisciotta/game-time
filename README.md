# Cake Walk

## About

Cake Walk is built using JavaScript, jQuery, and HTML5 canvas. It is tested with Mocha and Chai. The game's protagonist, Billy, is a child who hates vegetables, and the player's goal is to help him dodge the vegetables in the first part of the game canvas. In the second part of the game canvas, Billy avoids a gym floor by jumping from junk food to junk food; if he hits the ground, he loses his life. Once you reach the cake, Billy has successfully completed a level.

As a player advances levels, the obstacles and platforms (both vegetables and junk food) begin moving faster and increment with each level advance so the game increases in difficulty. The player gets 10 pounds each time Billy is able to advance.
